 gre_phalanx_desc:0 "The phalanx was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons. The term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. Arrian uses the term in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. In Greek texts, the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. They marched forward as one entity."

 ME_Ottoman_Events.1.d:0 "The Sultan Murad II, famed for the conquest of the Beyliks in Anatolia and the Kingdoms in the Balkans, led the Ottoman army to victory against the Christian Coalition at the Battle of Varna not long ago. It is said that he dismounted and fell to his knees and prayed mid-battle, something a legendary Caliph had done. The battle immediately turned in their favor. Murad II styled himself like this - a Ghazi King - strongly, as one meant to embody the virtues of an honest warrior. Despite that, he had grown tired of his nearly two decades of constant warfare, for he did not enjoy ruling from the throne or the responsibilities that went with it. He decided to abdicate the throne to his son, Mehmed II following the victory at Varna.

During the early years of the Ottoman Empire, beylerbeys served as gubernatorial offices, first established as such by Sultan Murad I in the 1360's.

Subsequently, the eyalets, or provinces, became the primary building block of the Ottoman provincial system. Unlike beylerbeys, eyalets had a range of autonomy; beylerbeys reported directly and were appointed by the Sultan."
