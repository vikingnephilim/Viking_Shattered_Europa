In Britain and Ireland this decline moved more slowly, but traditional religion was gradually eroded through the pressures of political subjugation; today the Druidic religion is spoken only on the western periphery of Europe, in restricted areas of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany (in this last instance largely as a result of immigration from Britain from the 4th to the 7th century ad). It is not surprising, therefore, that the unsettled and uneven history of the Druids has affected the documentation of their culture and religion."

This 'force' was maintained by leading a virtuous life and nobles were believed to be born with far more of it than commoners. As a result of this belief, legitimacy to rule was derived directly from religion and thus Tarascan elites made a greater effort to convert conquered peoples than other states of the era."

Mixtec faith differs in that the various ‘forces’ present in living things were personified in ‘images’ and concrete deities. In some Mixtec origin stories, revered ancestors were viewed as having arisen from a particular sacred river and then proceeding to create the deities and forces of the earth. This reciprocity produced a contract in which Mixtecs viewed death as a natural part of ‘feeding the earth’."

The apparition became known as Our Lady of Palmar. Many people came to witness the supposed apparitions, and a number of miracles similar to those alleged to have happened at Fatima, Garabandal and Medugorje were said to have occurred. The seers had many supporters, including priests. As common in most traditionalist Catholic environments, the Palmarian Church displays a number of traditional devotions. The most important one is the Holy Penitential Rosary. Every Palmarian faithful has the obligation of praying the Penitential Rosary everyday; lay people generally pray it during the celebration of the turns of Masses inside the Palmarian Basilica."

The mythology of Muism is orally recited during gut rituals. In Jeju, these are called bon-puri. Muism can be traced back to 1,000 BC. The religion has been part of the culture of the Korean Peninsula since then. Historically, Muism was an orally transmitted tradition that was mastered mainly by illiterate low-ranking women within the neo-Confucian hierarchy. However, several records and texts have documented the origin of Muism. One of these texts is Wei Shi which traces Muism to the third century. Evidently, the history of Muism remains a mystery. However, foreign religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism have influenced the development of Muism."
